Hello there, I'm [Peter Finnerty](/img/Peter_Finnerty_Portrait.jpg). Check out my [CV](/pdf/Peter_Finnerty_CV.pdf) and [letters of recommendation](/pdf/Recommendation_Guyon.pdf)!

I'm a recent graduate of LSE's MSc programme in Development Studies. I've spent the past year studying financial technology in developing countries, with specific emphasis on user experience with digital credit applications. I'm currently looking for a role in product analytics for a startup where I can dig into data to improve user experience.

I previously worked at Citigroup as an analyst with ICG Analytics, a statistical consulting division of the Investment and Corporate Banks. I worked on visualizations and reporting, which typically were used in C-suite presentations and [investor days](https://www.citigroup.com/citi/investor/investor-day/2017/data/p_institutional_clients_group170725.pdf). While there, I taught R to a team of 15 and programmed tools to automate revenue reporting for teams in New York and London.

Prior to LSE and Citi, I was a student at Boston College. I graduated *magna cum laude* with a BS in Finance and Information Systems. I minored in Sociology and combined these studies into a critique of student debt for Social Eyes, which you can see [here](https://www.bc.edu/content/dam/files/schools/cas_sites/sociology/pdf/socialeyes7.pdf#page=41). I was on [4Boston](https://www.bc.edu/content/bc-web/offices/mission-ministry/sites/campus-ministry/service/4boston.html#join) council, leading weekly volunteering at [Women's Lunch Place](https://womenslunchplace.org/).

For fun, I love to [run](https://www.strava.com/athletes/18760479), [hike](/img/Kilimanjaro.jpg), and listen to podcasts. I've spent countless hours fly fishing and am obsessed with documentaries. I'm currently reading Love in the Time of Cholera and Algorthims to Live By.

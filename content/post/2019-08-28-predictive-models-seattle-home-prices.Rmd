This is my final presentation for Analytics and Business Intelligence, a course I completed during my senior year at BC.

In this project, I used linear regressions to explain what casues home prices and predictive models (Logistic, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree) to identify highly priced homes. [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction) is the dataset used for this project, which is from Kaggle and focues on King County, Washington. 

In the coming days, I'll post a markdown file with much of the code used to produce this presentation.
